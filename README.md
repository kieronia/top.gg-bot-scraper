# top.gg-bot-scraper

Funnily enough there were no ratelimits. I scraped every single bot (19800) in a short period of time and it does seem to be every bot - the pagenumbers when searched on google, showed no more bots and I can search any bot id on top.gg and it'll be in my text file

I'm currently getting help from a friend to automatically add bots to a server. This way you can essentially boost online member counts for 60c per 1k members.

I plan on setting up an automessager that will go through an array of every character, maybe every combo of 2 characters followed by the word "help", with multiple token support, this way I can trigger lots of the bots at once and cause some chaos.


Note : Scraping off top.gg is likely against their tos 

Note : Automatically adding bots is against discord tos

If it's against the tos do not do it , I made this for a proof of concept and don't expect it to be used
